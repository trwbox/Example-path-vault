This is a copy of an obsidian vault from reddit user u/Luara44x. Who was having issues with a non-root domain being the base for obsidian-zola. 

The non-root path works fine for the homepage links like on this page [https://www.trwbox.com/Example-path-vault/docs/](https://www.trwbox.com/Example-path-vault/docs/).

When going to a specific markdown page they stop working correctly like on this page [https://www.trwbox.com/Example-path-vault/docs/movement/airhop/](https://www.trwbox.com/Example-path-vault/docs/movement/airhop/) where `wallhop` does not have the correct path leading to a 404 error
